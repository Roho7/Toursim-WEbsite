          <h2>Luqaimat</h2>
          <p>
            These warm dumplings have a doughnut-like flavour and texture. Fresh
            batches are made everyday and served with a sticky date sauce and
            sesame seeds. Local Bites Café in Jumeirah is an excellent place to
            taste them in the middle of the morning with a cup of steaming
            coffee.

          <h2>Knafeh</h2>
          <p>
            Originating in Palestine, this pastry delicacy has become a solid
            favourite among UAE residents. It's best eaten right away because
            it's created with sour cheese, crisp sugar syrup, and dough. Qwaider
            Al Nabulsi in Deira is one of the most popular venues to try it.
            During Ramadan, orders for this dessert might number in the
            thousands each day, as people ask for it for iftar - the meal eaten
            by Muslims at dusk to break their fast.

          <h2>Camel</h2>
          <p>
            Emiratis have always avoided eating camel meat, but modern chefs in
            the city are increasingly experimenting with everything from camel
            sliders to camel biryani, burgers, and stews. Camel milk, which is
            somewhat saltier than cow's milk, contains more protein, less
            cholesterol, and more vitamin C and iron. Don't want to drink the
            entire glass? Instead, try camel milk ice cream. Arab cafés
            throughout the city provide a variety of flavours, including
            pistachio, chocolate, and date.

          <h2>Turkish Cocktails</h2>
          <p>
            Dubai is hardly a dry city, and its cocktail scene is becoming more
            vibrant. Ruya's Anatolian Fizz, prepared with sparkling wine,
            pomegranate molasses, lemon, rose and raspberry, is a must-try.
            Ruya's drinks incorporate traditional Turkish flavour such as
            hibiscus, rose, pomegranate, honey, spices, citrus, and mint.

          <h2>Samboosa</h2>
          <p>
            These hot pastry appetisers, like many other cuisines in the
            Emirates, were influenced by flavours and methods from across the
            Arabian Sea in India. Some are loaded with meat, veggies, and
            spices, but the most famous local variety is stuffed with three
            different kinds of cheese.

          <h2>Arabic coffee and dates</h2>
          <p>
            Arabic coffee is provided free of charge everywhere in the UAE, from
            government buildings to hotel lobbies. Head to Café Bateel and enjoy
            the Bateel specialty qahwa, a traditional Arabic coffee brewed with
            lightly roasted beans and cardamom and served with organic local
            dates.
