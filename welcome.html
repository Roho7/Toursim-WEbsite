          Thanks to its strategic location between Europe, Asia, and Africa,
          Dubai first came into light as a prominent trading center in the 19th
          century. Owing to its strong pearl industry and proximity to the spice
          trade route, Dubai very quickly became one of the most successful
          trading hubs worldwide.
